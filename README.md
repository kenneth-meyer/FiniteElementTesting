# FiniteElementTesting
A personal finite element library to explore potential research directions

## Why am I doing this

It's been a while since I have implemented my own finite element code. The last time I built something from scratch was Fall 2021 in COE352, an undergraduate course at The University of Texas at Austin. Time to get back into it!
